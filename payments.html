      <h1 class="h3">By direct bank transfer</h1>
     </header>
     <p>That is to pay directly in my Italian bank account. If you opt to pay
      this way you will first need to ask me my bank account number. I haven't
      published it here because I want people to be aware of bank fees
      <em>before</em> they pay money into my account - they usually apply both
      to me and you and in some cases can greatly reduce the sum I get.</p>
     <dl>
      <dt>if you live in an European country using the euro or the Swedish crown
       (SEK), excluding the UK</dt>
      <dd>
       <a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.poste.it/bancoposta/pmi/incassi_pagamenti/bonifico_estero.shtml">My
        Italian bank does not charge any fee for receiving cross-border bank
        transfers on condition that they are made in euros or SEK</a>.
       <p>Anyway your bank may still charge a fee. Please check if the latter is not
        too much compared to the amount you want to donate or to pay for my
        one-to-one lessons.</p>
       <p>This is especially significant for single-lesson payments or small
        donations. In this case you are likely to donate to the bank rather than
        to me!</p>
       <p>PS: as set by current EEC regulations, any fee applied to bank transfers
        from euros/SEK to euros cannot exceed the amount you pay for domestic
        transfers. E.g. my Italian bank charges 1 euro for sending both domestic
        and international bank transfers.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>if you live outside Europe or in the UK, namely your local currency is
       neither euros nor SEK</dt>
      <dd>
       <p>In this case my bank charges me € 7.5 + mininum between € 1.5 and
        0.15% of the amount received. Your bank will also charge similarly or
        even more to send the money. We would probably be both better off if you
        <a href="#online">use an online payment method</a>.</p>
       <p>Even if you are rich, please refrain from sending me large amount of
        money this way. <a href="contact.html">Get in touch</a> for better ways
        to sponsor me.</p>
