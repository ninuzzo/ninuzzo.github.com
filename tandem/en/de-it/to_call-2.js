If the subject is expressed, it would be 'io mi chiamo Antonio'. 'mi' means myself, so 'mi chiamo Antonio' literally means '(I) myself call Antonio', reordered 'I call myself Antonio', that is 'I am called Antonio'. This can also be used formally both in Italian and German, unlike 'ich bin Antonio' and 'io sono Antonio'."]],

 ['def', "my cat", "meine Katze", ["il mio gatto", "la mia gatta"], ["German: mein-e, the -e is because cat is feminine.", "Italian: il mi-o gatt-o, l-a mi-a gatt-a, the my cat, the is needed in Italian even before my, your and similar words denoting possession (there a few exceptions, though)."]],
 ['def', "my cat's name is Tom", "meine Katze heißt Tom", "il mio gatto si chiama Tom", ["Idiomatically, we use chiamarsi even for non verbal animals or inanimate objects, where it means 'to call itself', although they cannot really call itself something, because they do not speak! But this is simply an idiom in Italian, it does not necessarily imply reflexion. Even though mi (myself) is used, we do not really mean that 'my cat calls itself Tom' here, as we are saying literally, but just 'my cat is called Tom'.", "German more logically prefers to use a non reflexive verb heißen for this meaning, which goes well with everybody and everything. In German reflexive verbs always imply self-reflexion, but it is not always this way in Italian as we have just seen. If we want to express real self-reflection in Italian we say '(io) chiamo me stesso', '(lui) chiama se stesso' (masculine), '(lei) chiama se stessa' (feminine). By adding stesso/stessa right after me/se, we stress me/se and thus the combination 'me/se stesso' really means a reflexive myself/oneself. Consequently you cannot use 'stesso' together with chiamarsi for your cat or a building, a country, or anything that does not speak. That is, if you say 'il mio gatto chiama se stesso Tom', it really means that your cat can speak! That is syntactically correct, but semantically is an impossibility."]],

'Per piacere/favore' both mean 'for favour', 'for doing me a favour', that is 'please'. In Italian (and Latin) 'per' means 'for', but we do not use it like in English. E.g. 'for you' is 'per te', but 'per month' in Italian is 'to the month', 'al mese', 'al' being the contraction of 'a il' (to the)."],

You can throw in 'please/bitte/per favore' at the end, of course, for more politeness. 'Chi sta parlando?' is used only in person, when you hear someone speaking but you do not see him and want to ask who he is.

(for the nearest place), 'or is it there?=o è là?' (when pointing further away). Be aware that 'da' in Italian means 'from', while in German 'there' (from, da in German is aus or von)."],

Btw In Italian, 'qua qua' is also the cry of ducks, 'quack quack' in English. That will maybe help you to remember: here in Italian is... like the ducks :)"],

 ['def', ["hello", "hi"], "hallo", "ciao", "English and German use these words for greetings and as a salutation when answering the phone. Italian only as a salutation. In English the stress is on the o, but in German it can be put either on the a or the o."],

 ['def', "goodbye", "auf Wiedersehen", "arrivederci", "This is more formal in all three languages."],
 ['def', ["hello?", "hello!"], ["hallo?", "hallo!"], ["pronto?", "pronto!"], ["As a question or an interjection, it is used to answer the phone.", "In Italian we do not use 'ciao' in this case, because we reserve that to greet people we already now. On the phone you cannot see people before speaking and so there is no way to know if you know the person in advance: it could just be an unknown who dialled the wrong number. In Italian pronto means 'ready' and it may seem a bit impolite, but it is not considered so and is very common. It may rather be impolite to say 'sì?' (yes?) alone instead of 'pronto?'. It seems telephones were initially used by rather rude soldiers only, who did answer by saying 'are you ready?' (pronto?) or 'I'm ready!' (pronto!) :) They were probably all men, so they only used pronto? or pronto! and never pronta?, pronta! But why did they use this word in the first place? Some think that the reason is because when telephone switching was done manually by an operator you first spoke with him and then had to wait for him to put you through. When he was ready to do that, he asked you whether you were still there waiting for the connection by saying 'pronto?' (are you ready? the callee is available and I'm about to connect you) or he just said 'pronto!' assuming you were still there (meaning 'the line is ready! I will connect you shortly.'). You could also have been the one to ask the operator 'pronto?', meaning 'is the connection ready?', e.g. if it is taking too long and you got impatient. In modern telephony any switching is perfomed automatically by machines, but the use of 'pronto?' or 'pronto!' persisted, as a way for the callee to confirm to the caller he has picked up the phone and is ready to listen to him. Therefore it is not a salutation as hello/hallo in English and German. Salutations are usually added later in Italian, first by the caller and then by the callee. Some callers may say 'pronto!' (not a question), meaning they are ready. This seems more logical than asking whether the caller is ready, which is quite redundant. Anyway 'pronto!' may be considered a bit abrupt, although it may only mean 'I hear you. Tell me!'. Unless one is lazy or depressed or wants to be abrupt, he would usually say 'pronto?', that is a question with inflection when answering the phone. Whatever the exact reason why we say 'pronto?' is, that's the way it is! So remember, in Italian the callee usually answers the phone by asking if the caller is ready, for how it may seem strange, it serves the function of both a neutral salutation and a signal that someone has picked up the call."]],
 ['def', "hello, who's speaking (there)?", "hallo, wer spricht da?", "pronto, chi parla?", "Since there is no question mark after pronto, it actually means that you are ready here, but even if you are a female, you never say 'pronta', because it is a set phrase.

'di' here gets elided into d' because the next word (avere) begins with a vowel (a).
