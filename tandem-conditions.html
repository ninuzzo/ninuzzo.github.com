     <h2 class="h3">Important conditions and requirements when exchanging languages with me</h2>
    </header>
    <p><em>Please read all this page carefully before engaging in a language
     exchange with me. Thank you for your patience and for respecting my
     time</em>.</p>
    <p>Exchanges with me are completely free. But in order to have a fruitful
     exchange and to both benefit from our exchange, you have to be fluent in
     the language you are teaching me. That is it should be your mother tongue
     or alternatively you should know it very well to be able to say anything
     you want and to always be able to tell right from wrong sentences, without
     any doubt.</p>
    <p>Your pronunciation should be correct too, accent doesn't matter as long
     as it is native or at least near-native. You also need to know enough
     English for explanations. You do not need to be a teacher and know about
     grammar jargon, but you still have to be able to explain the structure of
     sentences and single words in your mother tongue, to compare it to English,
     to give the most direct English translation for every word and to list all
     the correct ways one can change the order of words in a sentence and their
     difference in meaning, if any.</p>
    <p>I possess all the above prerequisites for Italian, the only language
     that I am confident to be able to teach you well and indeed it is my
     mother tongue. You have to meet the same requirements in the language you
     want to teach me. E.g. I do not even try to teach English, although I have
     a very good command of it. I hope you understand these constraints exist
     to ensure that the quality of our tandem sessions remains high and we both
     learn each other's language correctly. There is no intention to discriminate
     against bad language speakers.</p>
    <p>Our initial levels should match too. If the language you want to teach
     me is already listed in the above menu, you can ascertain if our levels
     are the same by looking at my past exchange sessions - usually my level is
     no more than beginner, though. Here you can also try out my language
     exchange method online before you <a href="contact.html">book</a> a live
     exchange with me. If in doubt, ask me before what my initial level in the
     language you want to teach me in exchange for Italian is. This is to
     ensure that we both learn something new.
    <p>Anyway, if your language is not listed here and you do not know anything
     of Italian, it means that I also do not know anything of your language and
     in this case you can <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> right away for
     the very first "Italian-your language" exchange! You will get to know my
     exchange method as we use it during our first tandem, do not worry about
     having to know that in advance. It is indeed very simple and effective.</p>
    <p>If your language uses a non-Latin alphabet, you should be able to type
     its characters in the chat window, so that I can learn how it is
     written. I will do the same for Italian, of course.</p>
    <p>I am a language enthusiast and thus am interested in exchanging any
     language, it doesn't matter how widespread or difficult is. My method
     makes any language exchange simple and funny for both.</p>
    <p>Least but not last, you have to agree for our chat to be published here
     for other people (including you!) to benefit from my past exchanges for
     free. I do not disclose my language partners name or any of their personal
     details, I do not advertise third-party products or services on this site
     and indeed you are not required to tell me anything true about you. But
     instead, feel free to invent any content that is not strictly
     language-related during our chats.</p>
    <p>It is well to say I am only interested in exchanging languages.</p>
    <p>If you want to exchange without using any productive method (not
     necessarily mine, but mine is ready to use), I am sorry, you better find
     someone else. I am not up for casual chats that are not very productive.
     The aim here is to learn languages. We do not have to forget that.</p>
    <p>For the same reason, do not expect to have an exchange with me if you
     are only looking for casual online Italian friends, e.g. for telling you
     something about the Italian culture. Of course, we can choose the topics
     that interests us more for our exchanges, but without forgetting that the
     focus has to be language learning, we shouldn't get completely sidetracked
     from external factors. For example, we are not here just to translate the
     lyrics of that latest Italian pop singer who has just made the
     international hit of the moment. Please do not misunderstand me, I am not
     demoting the importance of culture, art, or music. These are very strong
     reasons for learning a foreign language. But you should not pretend to
     really understand a culture if you do not know the language first.</p>
    <p>My language tandems are not the right place to discuss about my tandem
     or <a href="method-to-teachers.html">teaching methods</a> too. Although I
     am always open to suggestions and new ideas in this area, this should not
     take most of our time, that should be better used to learn languages.</p>
    <p>That being said, I'm looking forward to learn something of the most
     exotic and authentic languages of the world, and you will learn the beautiful
     language set out by the literary genius of <a target="_blank"
